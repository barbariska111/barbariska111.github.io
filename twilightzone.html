        <h3 {text-align: center;} style="color: #800080;"><p style="font-family:Pecita">This huge oceanic wilderness contains many large atolls, most of which are virtually unexplored. In fact, the only reef that has been explored in any detail, at least beyond a depth of ~150 m, is Osprey Reef. Consequently, this expedition has greatly expanded our knowledge of the ecosystems occurring in the deep Coral Sea.</p></centre>

        <h3 {text-align: center;} style="color: #800080;"><p style="font-family:Pecita">One of the aspects of ecology that most interests me is how communities change along environmental gradients, particularly depth. The underwater environment changes dramatically with depth, with steep declines in light irradiance and temperature from the surface to the deep sea.</p></centre>

        <h3 {text-align: center;} style="color: #4B0082;"><p style="font-family:Pecita">The dim, purple light in these habitats has led to the mesophotic zone sometimes being referred to as the ‘twilight zone’.</p></centre>
        <br>
        <h4 style= "color: #4B0082;"><p style="font-family:Pecita">The steep decline in light irradiance clearly presents challenges for photosynthetic organisms such as corals, algae, and phytoplankton. But still not so interesting.</p></centre>
